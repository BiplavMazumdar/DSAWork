Time Complexity Of A Computer Program

Time complexity is the time taken by an algorithm/program to run as a function of the length of the input.

Why is it so important?

It can clearly distinguish between two different algorithms based on their efficiency.
It’s independent of the machine on which the algorithm is run.
We can get a direct correlation with the length of the input.
